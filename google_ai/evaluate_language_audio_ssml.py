FORMATTING_PROMPT = """

Format your response as valid SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) with the following structure:

<speak>
  <voice name="[VOICE FOR USER'S NATIVE LANGUAGE]">
    [Your constructive feedback in the user's native language. For EVERY word or phrase in the target language, regardless of length, switch to the target language voice, like this: <voice name="[VOICE FOR TARGET LANGUAGE]">target language word or phrase</voice>. This includes individual words, short phrases, and full sentences.]
  </voice>
  ###Pronunciation: INT,
    Grammar: INT,
    Content: INT
</speak>

Example SSML output:
<speak>
  <voice name="en-US-Standard-A">
    That was a good try! Your pronunciation of the words was mostly clear. 
    However,  to make the sentence grammatically correct. You need to include 
    <voice name="de-DE-Standard-A">und</voice> which means "and" between <voice name="de-DE-Standard-A">Bier</voice>
     and <voice name="de-DE-Standard-A">einen</voice>. 
    Also, instead of <voice name="de-DE-Standard-A">bitteschön</voice>, 
    it would be more natural to say <voice name="de-DE-Standard-A">Bitte</voice> at the end of your order. 
    A correct version would be: <voice name="de-DE-Standard-A">Ich möchte ein Bier und einen Hamburger, bitte.</voice> 
    Keep practicing!
  </voice>
  ###Pronunciation: 7,
    Grammar: 6,
    Content: 8
</speak>

It is crucial to switch to the target language voice for EVERY instance of the target language, even for single words. This ensures accurate pronunciation for the learner.

Ensure that you use appropriate voice names for each language. Common voice names include:
- English: en-US-Standard-A
- German: de-DE-Standard-A
- French: fr-FR-Standard-A
- Spanish: es-ES-Standard-A
- Serbian: sr-RS-Standard-A
- Croatian: sr-RS-Standard-A
- Hrvatski: sr-RS-Standard-A
